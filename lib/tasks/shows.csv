       This show was one of, if not, THE best show I've seen the biscuits put on. For the most part, I'm very picky about what a show that's worth praise is. Unfortunately, as hard as it is to admit, Bisco has raised my standards so much as for what to expect from a jam band, that I cannot even fully appreciate many of the other good bands in the circuit as much, because plainly said, Bisco has spoiled me rotten. And anyone who was at this show would know what I'm talking about.

       Not knowing what to expect, as usual, several of my friends and I braced ourselves as the house lights went down, ready for our daily ass- kicking from the most under appreciated band going right now, and this particular show got right under our skin from the first note of MEMPHIS right until that seemingly never ending encore that left me totally speechless. I don't ever recall seeing a show that literally had me jamming from beginning to end without a breather here and there, but the biscuits were extra nasty this night and were laying it down with a vengeance.

       The night before was an excellent show as well, despite the slight lack of theatrics I would normally expect from a Halloween show, but it wasn't until the next night  that things really started getting out of hand, so to speak, and as I headed out into the chilly Boston night for the after parties, it ocuured to me that seeing shows this intense has a down side to it, and that is that after an experience like that, even very good shows would seem mediocre in comparison.

       The Disco Biscuits ability, not just to blend several types of obscure musical tastes, but also to be perfectly sychronized night after night, coming in and out of songs, always in a different order, tearing down the foundation of each one and disecting each of them into fragments of a long improvisational jam  that has so many twists and turns and brings the listener to so many different levels, that to call them under appreciated would be a bit of an understatement. And if you still are unsure as to whether or not to go see them, I suggest you find a bootleg of this show.",NULL

Two years ago this very day you could find me and a few other lucky biscuits fans down in the bayou living it up beyond belief. Preparing ourselves to witness one of the greatest musical performances the band had ever unleashed. Little did we know the madness that was to insue at the Howling Wolf this evening. 

It had been a long and unbelievable journey. For me and mine the tour had started 20 days earlier. Seven of us embarked from New Jersey to Michigan to follow the best kept secret in music. We traversed the great roads of our nations for what seemed like ages. Shows passed, both wonderful and terrible things occured, and we just kept on going. By the time we reached the Music Farm in South Carolina there were only four of the original seven left. Moral was high for some and not so high for others. Our driver was disheartened and could take no more. Only two of the original seven still had the spirit and gumption to continue on. The show ended and a weary Brian Tamke and I were rideless. Wanting to continue but not knowing how. That is when The Beast stepped in. The Beast had a car, his friends car. His friends parents had entrusted the valiant vehicle to him, for one reason only, TO GET IT TO NEW ORLEANS TO IT'S RIGHTFUL OWNER. 

So it was settled. Me, Tamke and The Beast set out south to continue our mission. After surviving the Chemical Warfare Brigade we journeyed on. Skipping Alabama we arrived in Nawlin's a day early. We hit the streets consuming drinks the size no man had seen before. I had never been in such a wonderland of alcoholic debauchery in my life. Needless to say I dove right in and sucked up every bit of nonsense New Orleans had to offer. After two days of this madness the moment finally arrived. We gathered outside of the Howling Wolf. It was late, for the show was not to start until midnight or so. 

We piled into the venue and began our wait. The stage adorned with the palm trees that had become so familiar to me over the last couple of weeks. A level of comfort had set in over the month of april that I had never expected. At this point any small, dark, nasty hole The Disco Biscuits were playing in, felt just like home to me. Each venue had becoming increasingly similiar, and at this point the place mattered not, only the sounds and people had any affect. The only difference here was the crowd itself. Filled not only with the usual hippie and dancer kids off the street, but instead there was an older crowd. Men with notepads in there in hands and an inquisitive, but critical look in their eye. Jazz Fest is not just about having a good time. It is about bands stepping up, playing for the most analytical music fans in the world. The pressure was definitely on. 

The band took the stage and I took my spot, front left right in front of Brownstein. A place I had become very comfortable with over the last couple of weeks. The opening notes of House Dog signaled that the show had begun. The first jam was light, airy and colorful. Slowly building to a massive peak that sent the crowd into a frenzy. The second jam was so good that it rivaled the monster that had been dropped at the norva only a week earlier. I could tell there was something in the air, the band looked focused. All eyes closed, a look of concentration that we hadn't seen much this tour. The Spacebird that followed was equally large and was the first version to really show how much of a monster it could be. Next up was Jigsaw, and here is where the show REALLY took off. To this day, this Jigsaw is tied in my mind with 12/28/01 as the best ever played. Each jam was a well thought out piece of art, flowing seamlessly in and out of the composed sections. My jaw was on the floor and my feet high in the air when instead of the ending reggae section, they dropped the second Dublights ever. Fun fun fun, we skanked around the Howling Wolf, turning the place into a dub dance hall. At the end of Dublights, I wathched as Brownstein literally grabbed the final notes of Jigsaw out of thin air to bring the band back together. I swear i watched him jump up and grab this note, it was incredible. As if that wasn't enough, Barber with a wicked smile started up the cascading notes of Above the Waves. This Waves crashed through many different themes and sections before coming to an incredibly large ending. It made me think of those massive 99 Waves that I would never get to see. And I wondered if I would look back on this night the same way those lucky few looked back on the classic shows on 99 and 98.

Setbreak was long and HOT, and I dipped into a bar next door where I found myself dancing to 80's dance songs (weird). I returned ready for what was going to be the last set of the tour I had been on for over 20 days. The very end of a journey that had yielded my new friends I never dreamed of having and a new found confidence that I could get throught anything that life threw at me. Like I said, this tour was not all fun and games. It was to be the last night of the music that had gotten so deep into my soul that I knew it wasn't ever coming out. That this was going to be a part of me forever. 

The band got on stage and I immediately noticed Brownstein. Dripping sweat with a distant but concise look in his eye. THIS SHIT WAS GOING TO BE ON! Mulberry's started and instantly became the best version ever played. It was obvious that Mulberrys Dream couldn't contain the kind of jamming that this band was going to release. It ended, and slowly, very slowly, the first deep dark notes of Crickets crept in. The place was on fire, singing along 'SPLATTUMS!!!' This was what we, the fans, the band, jazz fest, the world were waiting for. This crickets jam still was so fucking intense that time stopped. Marc Brownstein transformed from a bass player in the Disco Biscuits, to a low end machine capable of emitting any sound that his tristed mind could conjour up. Sweat sprayed off of him as he, eyes closed, played the most well placed, brainfucking basslines I've ever heard in my life. During this Crickets jam, he became the bass player that you all know and love now. He owned the show from this point on. Just as the jam had grown so large that the roof was goinng to cave in, as the middle section of Crickets was heading our way to b'gock us out of our now useless rubber bodies, the jam took a hard left turn and Munchkin Invasion slugged us right in the face. I have never lept into the air so high. The munckin was a non stop techno stomp fest. The room was so hot I thoght i was going to die. But there was no stopping, my hair whipped from side to side as the room pulsated with a frightening energy. Things kept up this was as we reentered the dark twisted world of Crickets which came to a glorious ending.

Honestly the show should have ended here. It was about five in the morning. The sun was creeping in through the wooden windows of the howling wolf. I wondered what the outside world, even if it was jazzfest, would think if they knew what was going on in there. Slowly Barber started up the most perfect possible song choice for a moment like that. Spectacle gave us a little time to cool down, to think about what had just happened. To thy and let it sink into our head that we had just seen quite possibly the best performance this band had ever played. Even the Spectacle naysayers (Quang :) got in on the fun. The Vassilious that followed was filled with dark pulsing grooves and vibrations. It pulsed and grew like a swelling blaack heart, eventually exploding into the magnificent ending of Munchkin. 

I was ready for the encore. I was sure that I was going to get the Crystal Ball that I had been screaming for for 3 weeks. I thought that all of my annoying hooting and holllering would finally pay off and the song I wanted so desperately would be played. The band took the stage and I stared at them hopefully...'Cmon' I said 'you gotta play it'. I was scoffed at and confronted with clippers and Brownstein banter telling me that I would have to cut my dreads off for a Crystal Ball. I was dismayed, and unable to give them the satisfaction, so I quit my bitching and went on enjoying one of the best nights of my life. The pilin it high was good rock and roll for six o'clock in the morning. And the beautiful notes of Aceetobee brought began the morning and ended the night. The band left the stage to an ovation that was too loud for the amount of people in the room. It was 6am and almost noone had left the show. It was still nearly as crowded as it was at the start, which is rare even for a regular disco biscuits show. 

After milling around a bit, Me, The Beast and Brownstein hit the bar for a final shot. The question was raised...'Best show ever?' At that point the answer was quite obvious...'ABSOLUTELY!'

Now this all may seem a bit dramatic...but I swear in my head that is exactly how I remember this night. I know some of you were there and remember how much magic was in that room that night. And honestly in comes through on the discs...maybe moreso that any other CLASSIC show. I truly believe that 4/28/01 was as important a show in the history of this band as 12/30/99 and 9-1-01. Giant leaps forward were taken that night. And i'm sure that the bass player you all know and love right now found the niche he was looking for that night. Listen to the tapes and see what I mean...listen to the Crickets...shit is just incrdible. I've been reliving 4/28/01 all day long and it's been great. And I'm really upset that they're playing this great place again and I have to miss it. A lot has changed in these two years I guess. 

Thanks if you read all of this...I hope you enjoyed. And I really hope that if you haven't experienced a night like this with this band that you do...and that if you have, that it keeps on happening. I know I'm still lovin it.

Highlights were: The Digital Buddah might've been the best thing I've heard out of the 03.  Sound 1 looks like it's trying to be the song of the tour. This Sound 1 was EVEN BETTER than the Santa Ana 7/2 one, which blew me away. Somebody's been busy on that song and it is kicking so much ass. You could hear the >ATW coming about 15 minutes early but it didn't ruin
it. Those were the two big highlights of the first set. With the exception of the Humu, everything was incredible. ATW>HAB was a little too pretty for a late night throwdown, but it'll work well on the discs.

The sax guy might've been from the band Bizaar Bazar from the bay area. He was in some striped spider suit and I had seen him earlier in the festival walking around playing a beatbox drum machine on his back and sax on top. He was interesting and played for maybe 2 minutes. The perfect Biscuit guest. Then, all I have to say is CRIX>HDPF!!! Hear this jam and hear it soon. It had to be about an hour long and it was dark and deep and went to places that they don't seem to go to at every show. It's a weird place to be at 5 in the morning after 3 days of sleep deprived and a head full of stuff. They just swirled my brain into mush with that shit.

Jon was a monster during the late night. I've never seen him play with so much energy. He also was bouncin around and jumping and in full out 'I'm here to kick your ass' mode that I haven't seen him do very often. The music, of course, reflects this. Magner was especially great in the late night too. He was spreading multiple layers over all the jams and giving it
a really full sound. I cannot say enough about his playing for this show, especially after what I thought was a somewhat mediocre performance on his part at the Santa Ana show. Marc was as solid as normal and I don't know what I ever did without Sammy's E-drum. That shit makes me an E-tard.

Shows like this are dangerous to those of us who had to drive 10 hrs after a quick morning nap. Damn you Biscuits. Damn you.

Oh my gawd!!!!  Last night's show was far and away the greatest concert of any kind I've ever attended, and that says a lot.  I've seen sick shows by Phish, Moe., SCI, etc.. and I have never remotely reached the emotional peaks I did last night.  The first set was hot.  Floes opened in grand fashion and drifted effortlessly into the completion of 12/30's Mindless Dribble and back into Floes.  7-11 was next and it kicked ass into Mulberry's Dream.  Finally the set closed with a smokin Very Moon>Spy.  We were totally pleased however we had no idea what was to come.  NO IDEA!!!  Nothing and I mean nothing could have prepared me for what was to come in set 2.  This set was huge, gigantic, mammoth, just fucking unstoppable.  It was the kind of set you dream of.  The kind of set that just has so much fucking energy and flawless excecution and all you can do is pick your jaw up off the floor. I won't even get into details, I can't.  You just had to fucking be there.  I've never felt so good in my entire life as I did after midnight.  The set was an absolute masterpiece.  A perfect 10.  It fucking melted me.  I can't explain really but it changed my life.  This is why I love music so much.  It does amazing things to your soul.  I was out of my body during this set and when they swung back into the conclusion of Run Like Hell I was euphoric.  We all were.  The place fucking exploded.  After all I had just been through I was drained, physically and emotionaly.  I didn't think I could process another set of music, but when the lights went down and they busted into Svenghali I was right back where I left off in set 2. The jam ripped into the conclusion of the 12/29 Munchkin Invasion and I couldn't wipe the smile off my face.  How many fucking times could this show peak!!??  What could possibly come next??  The answer ..... Crickets!!!  A massive Crickets!!  It drifted in and out of Very Moon and slammed back into the conclusion and once again the place exploded.  I was shaking my head and screaming at the top of my lungs.  I have never felt so good. (Did I say that already??)  Then it became clear we were going to get one more.....Home Again.  Of course, what an appropriate choice.  They were home in Philly and so was I and it was New Year's eve (actually by this point it was like 3 am) and this was an amazing show.  The jam soared and once again we peaked.  I was floored, blown away, liquified!!!  We remained for 15 minutes screaming in extacy.  Just fucking screaming THANk YOU!!!!!   Amazing ",
