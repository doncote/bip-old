When tomorrow's where I want to go.
And everybody's talking 'bout who's their man.
As we're finding our way to the promise land.

But things just aren't as they seem to be,
And one day you're all locked up,
The next day you're free...

And it's dark outside.
All alone and it might slide by,
But now the king is gone,
And here we are Zex Sea,

ok, when they actually do start the song, barber does this fanning type of 
thing that goes like this:
  E               D  C#
E 
B 17 17 17 17 17  15 14
G x  x  x  x  x   x  x
D 14 14 14 14 17  12 11
A
E

which goes into the simple G > A thing.
(G- on the 3rd fret. A- on the 5th)
Listen to a tape to hear how many beats you play the A before going down 
to the G.

Then, after you slow it down at the end with the slow G, slowly strum 
these series of bar chords: 

  E     F     Ab    B        D  E
E 0     1     4     7        
B 0     1     4     7        7  9
G 1     2     5     8        7  9
D 2     3     6     9        7  9   (strum this last E fast)
A 2     3     6     9        5  7  
E 0     1     4     7              



Then it goes into the (ooooooohhhh) part, where you just play the A > G 
part again.
Which then goes into the bass solo, which marc plays over a Ebm > Bbm7.

Then after the bass solo they play over this progression:

Eb > F# > A > C# > Em > B > F   
(play twice, then they jumps into these next 2 riffs, which are played 
over a Bm7 > Em.)


E                                            7(h)8(p)7 (trills)

This then repeats for a bit, then eventually goes into the (OOooooohhhh) 
part again over the G > A.

then they play this riff which leads into the outro jam.

play this 4 times




-- Basis ending --
(listen for the key change to A major, where they all typically land on a 
E to start the outro jam.)
Is done over a A > D > G progression.

This is the ending riff. (play 4 times)

E 21 21 21 22 21 19 19   21 22 22 21 21

G              14 12 9
D
A
E

Then they just jam a bit more over that same 
A > D > G progression, until barber hits that ending riff again. then it 
goes into the  final part, which is this.

The onlookers in fear and shock
He bolted swiftly through the crowd

Gone behind a cloud of dust

Passed on tragedy Corrinado moves with ease
Eluding all authority with his own agility
Ducks down an alley to the center square bazaar
Soldiers yell, soldiers scream, don't let him get too far.

Corrinado hides down an alley
As Manilla's troops begin to rally
He lays behind the street snake charmer
and slips out of his prison pajamas

The Matador, the bull can run
Corrinado sidestepped everyone
Takes off towards the end of town
Drawing troops from all around

He knows he's got but one way out
His only route without a doubt
be fastest to the mighty cliffs
and jump for his own benefit

Passed on tragedy Corrinado moves with ease
Eluding all authority with his own agility
Ducks down an alley to the center square bazaar
Soldiers yell, soldiers scream, don't let him get too far.

While dodging shots adeptly till

2nd movement from Beethoven's 9th symphony

What I have tabbed out there is only about the first minute of the 
movement, which is about the only part you can get away with playing it 
with just one instrument.
Its in 3/4 and the sheet music i learned this from says the tempo is 113. 
The timing is the key here, cause you're basically playing a note on every 
single beat.

And you know I could give you cheer when the lights go out
But I can't feel my way in the darkness.

Kicking it around the whole damn day

so the story goes,
what do you know?
All the things that I thought that I knew went out the window.

There's a last time for everything,
What do you say?
It happens that way.
Stormed out yelling, gone forever, but she called me today...

And maybe, all that you want to be is all that you had to be,
When flakes of gold and fallen rubies are never enough, never enough
So you spend your time opening doors for everyone else but me.
In the morning time, the sky up above you, the sun'll come up.

I Work too hard so I buy myself style for walking the mile,
Hours a day that I spend doing nonsense worth somebody's while.

I'm gonna go out and jam
I'm gonna go out and party
I got a brand new mission
So bring your ass to the party

Cover it up
I know you got eyes,
you know you got time.
You want free from the octopus wrapped around your mind.

Run to the hills,
out on your own,
fig leaves for clothes.
Whip that tongue,
as you search for a grip,
and you reach for the phone.

And maybe, all that you want to be is all that you had to be,

You made it to the dance, but you're wearing a towel.

To be next to you, any which way
Now you're gone leaving me with all these questions

I know there's no alarm, 
And now we've made our choice. 

There is no turning back, 
You've always had the knack, 
To hear your inner voice.

But now you tune it out, 
And then begin to shout, 
Until your face turns red. 

And Amos pleads his case, 
And you remove his face, 
From what was once his head.

And if you ever see me in my dreams.
And if you know that life was what it seems.
And now you wish that it was yesterday.
But that's the price you have to pay.

No time to reminisce,
But time is what you miss,
It seems you've got no chance.

A mask to hide your face,
And wings to win your race,
We've had a change of plans.

And in the thick of night,
With not a speck of light,
And with your fingers curled.

How did you kill your friend,
And have you reached the end,
Of your forsaken world.

And if you ever see me in my dreams.
And if you know that life was what it seems.
And now you wish that it was yesterday.
But that's the price you have to pay.

The confrontation was a necessary act.
We traded in our lives but took a million back.
And in the end, it seems I get what I deserve.
But for one moment's time, I wish I had the nerve.","transcribed by Rich Steele

then...

And if you ever see me in my dreams..

Chorus 

              - E       5
              - B  7    5
A > D with a  - G    7  6     at the end of each line.
              - D       7
              - A
              - E  

that is only one way of playing the chorus part. basically you just need to make sure you're throwing in a F# note to a D note below it that resolves to a E note, which is part of the A major chord you go back into. So the whole thing is a A > D progression with a couple notes thrown in between.

Haleakala Crater,
Wait for the sun.

The morning it crept on,
the sky clear for day,
the wind blew by slowly,
the rivers were dry.

Up with my feet as I
 walked on the mountain,
a staff laid out before me
 and plenty of time.

Barley, the sun rose,
peeked above the crator,
the light hit the stars now,
and lit up the sky

Up came the heat,
as I walked on the mountain,
my legs trembled before me, 
I did not know why.","Halekala Crater by Jon Gutwillig

then I just start noodling around on this pattern and then it goes into a 
little jam or guitar solo. The key switches a little from D to G I believe (I 
use E mixolydian then to a D major I think). Use this as a basis..

The next time it breaks down at 6:20 is kinda tricky. I Just play a little 
solo in D at that point, then it goes back forth into some tension thing. All 
I really know is the riff he plays towards the end before the insanity 
starts. Goes like this..

See them wiggle slowly off the wall 
The rug beneath you moves
brings you to a seperate room

Sailing in this fantasy 
Like the different world you have in store 
Aroma's must ebb and flow
Dizzy your expected blow

Well I woke up in the basement 
no matches, teeth, or vital signs 
she was looking for her mama
I remember from the dreamscape

And I went to get a facelift 
but I still had to chill and wait in line 
While my brother gets a tummy tuck
And my brother gets a nosering

Because they knew too much.
Body count's up to ten,
I never planned as such.

Many more people will die,
If this story's not told,
But it may be too late.

When it's over I won't be around,
See the trees as they fall to the ground.
You could say that I warned you of this in the past,
And you hide in the shadows they cast.

I remember the time,
When I first met Lai.
I thought I had it made
The Chemical Warfare Brigade.

And then it happened again,
As it is with everything,
Too much was never enough.
It made us feel strong.

And Amos told me how,
He thought we could triple our buck.
We had to resort to Plan B,
'Cause our first plan had run out of luck.

Get it going it's just the same

Eulogy (the band plays this in Ab, I guess because it requires 
a fairly large vocal range and that's the key where it fits 
Barber's voice the best.  I recommend doing it in A, if you're 
playing alone.....much easier on the wrists):

I can't seem to get the chord structure of this song down, 
so I won't bother.  This is just that little guitar solo 
Barber plays a couple of times in the song.

And swim in the ice.

And then I'll be free.

But i feel the floes when i drive in my car.
Up on the mountain where the sea is space,
To live in the vacuum of this perfect place.

I didn't think I would ever change me.
but I know that it did, That the fruit that I was tempted by.
It didn't sink in, until the lights flashed in my eye.

And I knew they were flying up above in the sky.
I wouldn't let up  until I couldn't push anymore.
And I thought if I ever had a chance before,
And I was set up, and now I'd say my chances are poor.

And you run for your life,
And you hide from the lights as they shine from the sky.
When your life's on the line, 
And you think in your mind, are you ready to die?

How can I go on, and I'll live a long life you know
If I could outrun the whole damn state 
And I think of the time that I didn't have to run 
And then I thought it, I may never see the sun 

In the morning all I got left is my gun 
And I will use it to get myself out of this mess 
And I thought if I'd ever taken more or less 
Then I'd abuse it and all I'd have left is my stress

And you run for your life,
And you hide from the lights as they shine from the sky.

Lookin' for some food he would munch.

So I grabbed the fish and tossed it in the lake,
Thinking he could eat what he earned.
And if I caught him I would cut him a break,
But if I didn't it was not my concern.

Got me a sweet lookin' prize today,
Under the son of a gun it'll make you say,

Got me a new kinda recipe,
I got the deal for the meal of the century.

I was walkin' by the side of the road,
Thinkin' I would cook me a meal.
Along beside me came a mad horny toad,
Lookin' for some food he would steal.

So I grabbed the fish and held it up high,
Knowin' toads are known for their jump.
 then I looked the toad right in the thighs,
And noticed that they looked mighty plump.

I told them it was simply a godsend.

And up to the porch came a guy I didn't know,
Offerin' up his money for some.

In a hot air balloon, he crossed the sea
Once an airship tycoon, turned buffoon
Leaving his home marooned, attempted to flee

The shore where he's fantasized, his baby to be
Turns his gaze to the skies, he cries
Just give me one more try, to chase down my dream
Before I am done.

Unsure from the day, she prays
Hoping their getaway, will still come to be
Watching stars ricochet, she strays
Beyond the alleyway, where no one can see
Not anyone.

In the blink of an eye, she spies
The spot in the foggy skies, she's been longing to see
Camoflaged by the tides, she hides
Where the water and wind collide, she's soon to be free
 From what she's begun.

Corrinado flies over the sea

And in one day

Once again, this tab is for bass, but the same melody is played on guitar
and piano.  You can play it as written on guitar, but I'm sure it'd be the
wrong octave.  If you really want to play it and can't find a good
position on the guitar, write me and I'll suggest somethin.

This is the theme to the ending instrumental thingee, _Flight of the Hot
Air Balloon,_ if you will.

Never gave a thought there could ever be world peace

Well-to-do on the bone you savor.
a local invitational, a roaring hello,
Mind's racing but you just don't know.
What to do, How to stop it.
When the seeds that you sow are all microscopic.
And your tailor made suit, yo the man's best friend.
And the city boy's out of his mind again.

House call, do yourself a favor.
Take a big bite of the fruit of your labor.
When you might be dreaming, go back in time.
To chariots, wizardry and regicide.
Where the warriors and the armor have a different name,
And the church and the paupers play the same old game.
So you try to break the rules that you just can't bend,
and the city boy's out of his mind again.

Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
City boy's out of his mind again.
Oh yeah, oh yeah.
City boy's out of his mind again.

Sanitarium, and doing alright.
Three square meals and a bed for the night.
And you might be busted on the daily grind,
You got nurse Belinda and a porcupine.
So howling granny howl, and give'm a hoot,
and little nurse Belinda's licking off your boot
And you might even think that you like to pretend,
That its the city boy whose out of his mind again.

Now the next section after this before the jam starts i'm still not 100% 
sure on. 
i'll add it as soon as i work out all the kinks.)


Jam goes over a A > G.


then jon comes in with this riff, which is first
played 4 times before the ascending 10 count starts.

E   12  10 9 9 9 9 9 9 10   9(h)10 10 10 10(p)9

so basically you loop this riff 4 times, and  
the ascending part is just the last 3 notes repeating up to 10.

Flying south was good enough. 
In fact he'd like to stay.

Paradise was waiting and he knew they had to go.
He'd hope that she come with him. 
And he'd hope they take it slow.
In a flash they packed a bag, and left their home behind.
They spread their wings and caught a breeze,

When they arrived he noticed other birds were diving fast.
He made a note and flapped his wings 
And other birds they passed.

He wondered why they're diving in an ordinary bay.
But he knew this wasn't diving in an ordinary way.
He took a breath and dipped his nose and headed for the sea.
What he did not know was that this dive would set him free.

the call you're waiting for but never comes drives me berserk

and dripping as the tears seemed the same as falling rain
a storming silent passion but cerebral not to tame
her entertaining what the masses want for all it's just the same

Jamillia I wanna feel ya up

it fades away too soon and in just a couple days
my _________ freely lifts up in all its many ways
for years pass, now I know I made a big mistake
your eyes can illustrate in one look a simple craze

but though we can't reconcile what is past
you know my deepest thoughts but in the shallow end you cast
and though my thoughts are with you in an ordinary frame
my mind's a dirty thing and will forget just the same

You slide into the world
The womb you have to leave
To be a boy or girl

When the man steals your nature with his watch
All in time a bit of peace, in time the chaos stops
Yellin' but you just can't find the words
Gaia, still loves all the pieces, of her jigsaw earth

Gaia...

Jacob left in the dark of night, hopped into his car
Finding street-wise Sandibel , and a volunteer chauffeur
Didn't see no reason to take a third
Gaia still loves all the trees, home to all the birds

Gaia's jigsaw earth is free.
Early in the morning, rise and shine, and the world is callin'.
Gaia's actuality.
Sky, the ground, and a place to roam,
Circus in a bubble, a place called home.

Jacob sat on empty, Sandibel got tied up
The volunteer put on her clothes and pilfered her make-up
Guaranteed to be back for them soon
Gaia makes and takes the rain how ever opportune

Gaia's jigsaw earth is free.
Early in the morning, rise and shine, and the world is callin'.
Gaia's actuality.
Sky, the ground, and a place to roam,
Circus in a bubble, a place called home.

I gathered myself, and rubbed my eyes, and wondered, did she know?
That I put glass and concrete beams as tall as trees can grow.
That I tear down the oldest statues, faces who've grown long
She may have known, may not have cared, continued with her song...

Gaia's jigsaw earth is free.
Early in the morning, rise and shine, and the world is callin'.
Gaia's actuality.

Sister Judy said she's giving the ice a try
And I wondered if I was ever going to be the same
 
They call it ice because it freezes your brain
she told me about her mother that it had driven insane
And Sister Judy walked her into town
 
Then I saw something that I had never seen before
A pelican fishin at a quarter to four
And I knew Tragic Beach was a magical place
 
We stayed at Sister Judy's Shack
With so much food with ice to pack
And Sister Judy said these words to me
 
No one knows that you can't always get what you want
And no one knows that you can't always get what you need
And no one knows that you can't always get what you see
And no one knows that its never going to matter to me
 
I said to the pelican pleasure to meet you
He looked to his left and said 'how do you do?'
And the pelican continued with the matter at hand
 
He looked at my friend and said I got an idea
The two of them could take a walk and get us some beer
And you and me can try to catch some dinner
 
My friend took a hike and me and pelly took a seat
and Sister Judy came around the brim of the tree
the pelican said to Judy 'did you have a wonderful day?'
 
We walked in Sister Judy's tracks
within her soul and towards her shack
and Sister Judy sang these words to me
 
No one knows that you can't always get what you want
And no one knows that you can't always get what you need
And no one knows that you can't always get what you see
And no one knows that its never going to matter to me",,"'Sister Judy's Soul Shack' is a reworked version of The Maui Project's 'No Matter'.","0"

Everything she did was done in vain.

Little Lai had a business proposition,
And he knew that I wouldn't say no.
He took me into the glow of the cabana,
And he asked all the ladies to go.
He used a key the kind I'd never seen,
And the box opened up in the light.
Lai assured me that the deal was good,
And that the ladies were the rest of the night.

And he didn't know where he was going,
Last I saw Little Lai he was boarding the train.

As wind gathers firmly in my canopy.
We dive through the mist to the autumn sun,
My vessel and its crew of twenty one, and we fly.

Through burgundy smoke and a fear of home,
Alas, my final mission to the great unknown.
As my thoughts betray me in flashes so bold,
I'm reminded of home where the coast shines like gold.

darkness, thunderstorm, a ship going down,
the crashing of rain and its deafening sound.
as the crew ties the sails blown aside by the wind,
crashing from the waves come tumbling in and we fly.

Rolling like a cobra, one life to spend,
drifting through the heavens where the oceans they end.
and there's no longer the sea no longer the sun,
my ship and the waves have all swirled into one.

And i'm off past the vision, the line of the light,
Where oceans turn waterfalls, daytime turns night.
And no people return, no stories to tell,
And i watched through the door for the toll of the bell.

And we fly...

One with the raging wind,
Alive on the highest tides,
My ship at sail can climb a mountain,
Ride it to the sky.

Whoa...oh, he'll navigate!

Earlier up this morning, as I sit upon the bow,
In the distance, my homeland, but I just don't know how.
Years along the sea, and I thought I'd find the sun.
Once around the world, and now I think I'm done.","transcribed by Rich Steele

And cleaned herself up solemnly before she faced the beast

Just figured this one out yesterday....too fun not to share.  The only
parts I'm still a little shaky on are The Riff from the intro and the
chords under the chorus....but both are reasonable approximations.

FWIW, all the HAB tunes I've tabbed are from the 12/31/98 version, since
those performances are pretty grounded and manageable.  Things evolve over
time, so YMMV.


Intro:

C jam

Brownstein defines the chord like so:
d-------2-5--
a----3-3-----

(repeat a lotta buncha times....jam.....)

Magner's playing arpeggios than can be approximated on guitar like so:
e----0----1--3--1-1------
b-----1-0--1--1----1-1---
g------0----0--0----0----

Or something...listen to it and you'll hear what I mean.

Intro melody 1 (I know Barber plays these in a different position, but
whatever):
     C            *             F
e-------0--3--7--8--8s5---0--3--1-----
b----1--------------------------------
g----------0--4--5--5s2------0--------
d-------2-----------------2-----3-----
a----3--------------------------------

F piano arpeggio is like this:

e----1-----3----5----3-3------
b-----1-1---1----1------1-1---  (x 2)
g------2-----2----2------2----

Then repeat Melody 1, except from the * on play:

     C         Dm
e----8s5---0-----------
b--------------3-------
g----5s2---------------
d----------2---0-------

Dm arpeggio (again, all of these are just to give you an idea of what's
going on- listen to it, you'll hear what I mean):

e----------0----1----0-------
b----3------3----3----3-3----  (x 2)
g-----2-2----2----2----2-----
d------0---------------------

Melody 1 again, from the * on play
                        G
e----10--12--13-15--17--19-----
b------------------------------
g----7---9---10-12--14--15-----

G arpeggio:

e-------------------1s3-1---------
b----0----1----3---------3-1-3----
g-----0----0----0----------------- (x 2)
d------0----0----0----------------

Intro melody 2:
     G                                          C
e----19---15---17---17-15-17-15-13---13-13--10--8----
b----------------------------------------------------
g----15---12---14---14-12-14-12-10---10-10--7---5----

C arpeggio (Barber actually plays this one):
e-------------------3s5---------
b---------3----5-------6-3-5----
g----5-----5----5--------------- (x 4)
d-----5-----5----5--------------
a------3------------------------

The Riff (best I can figure it):
e-----------------------13------15s17----------12-12----------
b----13--13-15s17-13--13--13--13-------15-15--------13-13----- (x 4)
g------12-----------12------12--------------------------------

Intro melody 3:
e----19--17--15--13--12-13-12----12-13------------
b----------------------------14-------15------------
g-----------------------------------------14-14----

(and Brownstein adds:)
a----2-------
E-----3-3----

(x 4, and then the last time add this transition lick into the verse):
                     F     D/F#  G
e----------------------------------
b----12-12h13-12--12-13-13-14----15

We come from the jungle.

Hi, my name is Sally.
I'm a little munchkin.

A little munchkin!","Tablature by Evan Leon:

Introduction:

F# | Bm | C# | C# (repeat)

The next section is the one with the really complicated rhythm that 
I don't really know how to transcribe.  All I can say is that the 
figure is repeated twice on A, then once on F#.  Following that, 
slide up to A for the first verse section.

For the verse section, Jon plays a short figure in A similar to 
the following (but usually different):

Figure 1:
e  9h10p9
B         12  10 10 10 9
G                          9
D                             11
A                                12
E

Play around on that for 4 measures, then break into a reggae-type 
strum on an A chord for seven measures, and the words start on the 
8th measure:

A
We come from the city,

Bm                      A (3 measures)
We come from the jungle.

Repeat that part, then to the bridge section:

Bm | D | F# | F#
Bm | D | F# | E A
F# | Bm | C# | C#
F# | Bm | A | A

Then Jon takes a solo over the bridge progression.

everyone started.",,"0"

The purple face asphyxiates, and pales from the fight

The girl had a chocolate bar
with a poem in it
Saying he was not the man

To get in on a two-bit plan
the boy went and parked his car
at the bowling alley
waiting for his ride.

The new idea don't hypnotize
the boy knocked a jewerly store
at the eve of twilight
with two friends of mine

Shopkeep, crack, quick enthrall
he turned, he cocked the shotgun
to avoid the violence
But it was justified.

Nowhere to kick us out
You've got the meaning all confused.
Break down the core reactor
blown all to pieces for the new

We broke through the window
The girl awoke to the sound
of chinese lanterns
crashing on the bed.

They raised the burning candles
the boy went across the floor 
to the open window
as they crashed the wall

Unknown inside the crosshairs
he took one last look at the girl
as he dropped the handle.
It was justified.

Nowhere to kick us out
You've got the meaning all confused.
Break down the core reactor
Blown all to pieces for the new

Earlier in sense of time
When buildings sang unspoken rhymes
And all who cared could stand so high
Had watched within a wandering eye

There came about a new idea
With lasers bold and banners sheer
It chanced among the countless wise
And tranced the Herculian prize

Once thwarted mists of Ice-9 Gold
Go drowning in the windless deep
And reaping wraths of dreams unsold
Make haunted ghosts of countless sheep

And waking warriors who once won
Now bow their heads to fire's heart
Their Dionysian prayers are stung
By battle freedom's perilous dart

Through force of time a spell was raised
Brought amidst the darkest night
Sentinals sent from sun soaked days

Quiet walk in the park. 
And the sun sinks and reddens.
Shelby Rose in the dark.
A yellow bird on a tree stump.
You take a stroll by the lake.
And when you see Shelby coming,
You feel your heart palpitate.

And I suppose I can tell Shelby Rose how I feel.
And I suppose I can tell Shelby Rose what I do.

And in a few days you tell her,
that the future is bright.
You fill her in on the prospect,
And she fills with delight.
It's a good thing you tell her.
Because you know that she'll stay. 
You celebrate with some champagne,
And you wake the next day.

Every day is a walk in the park, every afternoon to the days turn dark.
Every night is heaven sent.
Every night is heaven sent.
Every day that I spend with you, every afternoon that we go to the zoo.
Every place we ever went.
Every night is heaven sent.","transcribed by Rich Steele

Didn't know that masquerade, was hiding them all out of sight
So how to get out of...

When dreams escape reality
They never get where you need them to be
Distorted views of what we all see
How should we except the plea?

Just to sing you a lullaby
Of Spaga, the Intifada
His souvenir, the dragon's eye

FIRE breathes the dragon
Tooth for tooth,
and eye for eye
The knight in shining armor
The fair maiden, his battle cry

And with a prayer
for the maiden,
who would then lay him
So with his valour
He would soon tower
The Dragon's lair

Spaga's emerged in victory
Slain the beast for all to see
And the little knights courage knew to end
As he danced and dodged about the dragon's den

Avoiding fire breath and razor claws
Till the mighty dragon made his fatal flaw
When he turned to check the maiden's cell
Spaga thrust his sword with a terrific yell (alt. and sent him straight to hell)

The maiden saw Spaga standing tall
As he watched the beast take his final fall
His sword illuminated as the smoke cleared
He told her firmly 'come my dear'

So what then of the true reward
Said Spaga coyly as he sheated his sword
Anything you wish I ask of thee
Hand in hand immersed in glee","(that rise and fall part, or whatever you wanna call it :)

Sing a little song,
a little melody melody,
The words that make your world,
I'll make them grow.

Tiny is the sun,
aloof is the sky,
Wonder about the people walking by.

Funny as fate,
As hard as you try,
You can't pretend,
That life has no surprise.

Isn't life just a spectacle?
One hand short of a miracle.
And if you're body flies through the wind..
And you don't think you ever want it back again..

Well isn't life just an obstacle
That you can't wait to get around?
And you might break your face
Just to break the mold
Lift your hand and count you out.
Count it!

Shock me, Tell me about the story that you heard.
We've got all day to hammer out Just where it is absurd.
Spectacles and roundabouts and details afterwards,
You're gonna get it all today.

Wherever there's a road
Amazing you'll see
lines for glitter carpets on the rise.

I question the rogue, should I take the plea,
When i get just one chance to vocalize?

Asleep in the day, awake in the night,
Only so many roads to take your life.
The problem you see,
You can't mess with time
And take a different road you'd try.

Isn't life just a spectacle?
One hand short of a miracle.
And if you're butterflies through the wind..
And you don't think you want back in again..

Suddenly we have a vacuum.
In the mail a telegram, I could not wait, all aboard the caravan it leves today,
And then the night comes on, the lights turn low,
fall asleep, all alone,
Consider for a second the ways of the world.
Maybe I'll throw myself a bone.

Maybe I'll throw myself to the dogs,
But my back's not to the wall.
Maybe I'll lay some bricks for the man,
But the days just aren't that long.
So if I settle back and chill,
Will I see far enough to feel the angel's dream?
I thought it was the story of the world.

Can I call out and say, everybody here,
Lend me an ear to talk to.
Can I call out and scream, the ways of the world,
Have got me singing another tune.
But the words are so familiar, I heard it before.
And you might dare to sing along.
With the crickets out chirping a random song,
Maybe I'll throw myself a bone.

Maybe I'll throw myself to the dogs,
But my back's not to the wall.
Maybe I'll lay some bricks for the man,
But the days just aren't that long.
So if I settle back and chill,
Will I see far enough to feel the angel's dream?
I thought it was the story of the world.

When frick turns to frack, there's no turning back,
and you got a slip tongue and a smack attack.
and there's colors like green and you're wearing black,
and your phone got flat on a railroad track.
but then the sun comes up and the day moves on,
and the old routine takes its toll,
and you feel like a copier rolling along,
maybe you'd throw yourself a bone.

Maybe you'd throw yourself to the dogs,
but you back's not to the wall.
Maybe you'd lay some bricks for the man,

"195","tunnel","The Tunnel","Marc Brownstein","From rock to rock
and stone to stone,
It's what I do
when I'm alone.

With all the time,
such a place.
And now it seems,
without a face.

Laugh and mock
they don't believe,
I smile only
as they leave

Know I feel
a bit confused.
Its like the dream
where I can't move.

Alone at last,
the tide is low,
A greater pitch
in which to go.

The ocean swells,
I move away.
It follows me
as if to play.

Now I rest 
in nature's arms,
She holds me tight 
and free from harm.

In a different
world of mine,
There comes a voice
to tell the time.
Tell the time.
Tell the time.
Tell the time.

Does something else exist beyond the sky?
Will the angels walk or will they fly?
A familiar voice I haven't heard in years.
Tell me what to do in seven years.

And if its not my time can I come back?

Found myself in the tunnel of light,
and i didn't have the urge to fight.
Found myself in the tunnel of light,
and i didn't have the urge to fight.
Found myself in the tunnel of light,
and i didn't have the urge to fight.
Found myself in the tunnel of light,
and i didn't have the urge to fight.

A storm rolls in
but still i'm safe.
I find myself
within a cave.

The lightning strikes
like a spiderweb.
I catch my breath
on a concrete bed.

I can't remember 
certain things,
Like when and where
I got these wings.

The storm had passed
and the day was bright,
And each step
seemed aflight.

Now I've met
my guardian,
My lease on life
renewed again.

Peace has 
overwhelmed my soul,
And the toll collector
takes its toll.

Can i have 
a few more days,
To take in
just a few more rays?

Live the life 
that I'd always hoped.
And tend the plants
that I meant to grow.
Meant to grow.
Meant to grow.
Meant to grow.

Does something else exist beyond the sky?
Will the angels walk or will they fly?
A familiar voice I haven't heard in years.
Tell me what to do in seven years.

And if its not my time can I come back?

Found myself in the tunnel of light,
and i didn't have the urge to fight.
Found myself in the tunnel of light,
and i didn't have the urge to fight.
Found myself in the tunnel of light,
and i didn't have the urge to fight.
Found myself in the tunnel of light,
and i didn't have the urge to fight.","Tab by Jason Hill

So I call on the reigns of forces drawn in from afar

The walls have deceived me
I imagined this all on my own
These spirits around me, clouds of dust looking for a new home

When they tap on my shoulder, tell me I got what I deserve
I throw my arms & destroy them
Cause on this day they will eat all their words

So I call on the reigns of forces drawn in from afar

I can stop all the voices
and bang on the walls with my fists
But my only choice left
is the one I'd never dismiss

I hear the world through the echos
A song of life through the noise in the crowd
In this cell I've known plainly
That what I want is what is not allowed.

And as our bodies fly through space.

A spirit guides you from the sky.
And clouds obscure what pacifies...

Houses glowing brightly up in flames
So I take this chance and close my eyes

Walking down the avenue, a taxi in the road
I guess this must be time to hitch a ride
Can't forget the voices of the things that I've been told
It's not to say in time I haven't tried

Underneath the white streetlight,
Walkin' like a widow in the rain
Every day is another day gone by

Corners scraped and pulvarized,
Passion beats a heart of (?) pain
So I do my best to galvanize

Someday I'll be better, like myself of old
Someday I'll be better than before
Caught in a vendetta, but left out in the cold
There's simply just no room for anymore

Underneath the white streetlight,
Walkin' like a widow in the rain
Every day is another day gone by

I hope this song will make me sane,
I hope these words will rationalize my life
But still tomorrow brings another day

Than pocket change you'd find on the ground
And I question all the reasons, but come up with nothing more

Does the sun revolve around the earth?
Does reflection make the water blue?
Should I forget the dream I had last night?
Will I ever know just what to do?

I don't know what to do.

"81","hope","Hope","Jon Gutwillig","Mellow was the world when it began,
the alphabet and a master plan,
settled in the trees and growing like  a vine,
a delivery arriving back in time.

the officer revolt walks the beat with a bang,
for a millisecond and a boomerang,
as they walk away singing the peace is not so strong,
to turn the inside to the out and right to wrong

but silly as it is, when you can bang your head,
and who needs history when time just moves ahead,
as everything you want brings something else instead,
a hammerhead might taste the blood,
a ladybug might see the red,

There was a princess, her friend the mouse, and his little cheese,
and she wore these tiny slippers wear you'd think her toes were squeezed,
as she smiles on a swing, glides above a flower bed,
the gentle nature of a woman gives me hope to rest my head.

And hope fuels generations.
And hope can start your car.
And hope is the root of fantasy.
It's nothing but a star.

Which may be fleeting, may be bright.
May keep you staring at the night.
where one might question what life will be.
Quietly, I ask myself, 'Is there still hope for me?'

Hope is a generation.
Bang your head in the car.
And what is the root of fantasy?
Lay your bet on a star.","transcribed by Rich Steele

and left me but the voice
to warm your heart and spark your soul 
yet my words they go unheard

He's being nice to set you free 
when at my door a knocking sound
in your heart you're free with me
we'll plant our feet deep in the ground

I wish and pray if god could hear
it's not for money, luck or fame
walk with me and without fear
some nights I dream the days became

These words of love I say they said
all while I walk a different path
My love for you not counterfeit
some nights I dream to steal you back.

I wrote this song
To say hello
Just a few words from me

I play it for you
When you're in my bed
Where you oughta' be

And I could be riddled by those secrets
That make you wanna say 
Maybe lets go easy

But life has changed 
Don't uproot the tree in spring 
when all I wanna say

If only you called on the doctor
waited with kitchen mitts, anticipating
you just have to get your hands dirty sometimes
just like mine.

If only like shooting stars fare
You see what you dare 
The thoughts travel elsewhere 
Why can't you hijack a comet and fly?
Tell me why I always see 
We for tea 
You and me.

So sweet Georgia 
Why must I try 
When you like to rob and steal 
and all these people tell me to go find someone else
when you never cut me a good deal

So might I have to mention that we should blow them off
18 wheels and a ride
Miles of paranoia, lunatics in jail 
And still we're having a good time.

If only you called on the doctor
waited with kitchen mitts, anticipating
you just have to get your hands dirty sometimes
just like mine.

If only like shooting stars fare

But I don't ever see you try
So you think you have all the evidence

Corrinado swam like hell on fire
With jelly arms and beaten bones
He rode the crests, he broke the waves
Trying to get a breath of air for all that he had left to save

Mulberry let the engines burn
The airship lifting off the ground
He watched the sea, could not believe
That he thought Corrinado could be free, his life was now in vain

All was left one chance to fly away
He spun, he heard a gasping sound
But he did not see his friend

After the sun and light were gone
Before he found himself at home
Corrinado swam, fought the waves
Remembering when, a myriad of falls, behind another day

All was left one chance to fly away
just beyond his reach the plan
To reunite them once again

Caught in the waves as the wind whipped on
and the sand sat calmly miles below
He had to swim, to take the day
Hoping to see Mulberry when he crawled to reach his getaway

All was left one chance to fly away
Just beyond his reach the plan
To reunite them once again","transcribed by Rich Steele

then the rest is over the B chord I believe.

here's the next little riff he does.

E
B                            7(h)9(p)7 
G           9(h)11(p)9                  
D 7(h)9(p)7            9(p)7
A
E

E
B 9(h)11(p)9
G            9(p)7
D
A
E 
 (repeat once, then play the part before that again)

Then, on the first (above the waves....) play a
B major on the 7th fret on every 3rd beat. and a C# major > B major at the 
last (above the waves....).
On the next time around, instead of playing the B on every 3rd beat, it 
goes B > E, B > E alternating every other 3rd beat, until the last (above 
the waves...) where its a G#m > F# major. 
(If all this details just confuses you, just listen to a tape and listen 
for the chord changes.:)

then the song drops into F#m, where Jon comes in with this riff.

(now, after the jam, when it comes back into this section, you're 
basically playing the same thing as above, until right before the D-A-G-A 
part, where you play over these chords: F#m F Bb E A. After the last A, it 
goes into the D-A-G-A.) 

This is a simple D, A, G progression. Play the D on the 5th fret, the A 
also on the 5th, and the G on the 3rd. Figure out the rhythm and all that 
for yourself, cause its pretty simple. :)

Ok, the next part comes right after that last A chord. (..and he could not 
see his friend..)

then he comes back in with that same intro riff for 2 measures (i think), 
then he does something like this. (note: he first starts this a octave 
higher, but its much easier to learn it this way first)

And she never puts her feet on the ground

I follow her today, walking into town
Losing all the spies that follow her around
Well she gives them tears? shows me joy?
 Strawberry Girl, they sure are toys?
She likes to hear everyone get it all out
Cuz the girl is just a face in the crowd

Try to have fun, coma eight coma one see the video screen, never see the sun
Never play ball in the early fall, cause your old man never runs

You should always talk to me
You can always talk to me

Try not to let him notice that you just got high

You dropped visine, look straight ahead
You wished you could have talked to your dad instead

You talk about drugs, you talk about sex
And they give you some paper with a Med RX

Crumple it up and walked out the door

I'm bored, so I figured I'd give all the bass players in the house a
little finger workout.....I've got some more of this tabbed, but it's
trapped on my crippled computer....might drop it at a later date.

It's the bass melody toward the beginning, which is a recurring theme on
all three instruments throughout.  You can play it as is on guitar, but
it would definitely not be the ideal position.  I leave it to you to
figure out what would be.

From this point you can either noodle around on the A-minor scale or
try something like this, just make sure and tremolo pick the notes
starting on the 18, this is the buildup that leads into the ""suspended in the air""
part of the song.

Here is a lot of the basic riffs Barber plays during the ""trancier"" part of the song.

E phrygian, if you want to play along with the bassline just play E-minor and F-major.
Barber plays these off a scale starting at the 12th fret, but i like to play them in this position.

And wishing I had spoken all I had to say
Through your squinted eyes you see through my disguise

This song originated from the 12/29/02 Techno I-Man intro jam. This particular I-Man is traditionally known as the ""Gangster I-Man"" and the jam is found on the Trancefusion Radio Broadcast #2 under the track title ""Gangster Jam"".
<br><br>
Up until the Starland run in February of 2007, this jam was never played again. It was teased in the 12/29/04 Basis for a Day intro jam, but a ""full"" version was never played. It was included on the wheel at Starland and was eventually landed on (thanks Julia!) which lead to its revival. It is rumored that its comeback, along with its second showing the last night of the Starland run, is a good indication that it might be on the upcoming new album, although this is only speculation.","0"

What if I was in your dream? Maybe you’d believe. Maybe it would be real to me. Crawl all these miniaturized fantasies when you deserve it all, and Id wait but you’d make me wait just grab your hand and say.. I don’t mind if I have to sit and wait.

Exploring and revealing many parallel selves
Pealing away the layers at play
Uncovering the inner pulse of Venus today

Thinking that it may explain the meaning before
All is told, and secrets unfold
And all of us may be freezing, left out in the cold

Spinning on a psychoactive merry go-round
Liquid crystal display, everyday-

You're getting sued.
Bummer, dude.
But you just don't know when it'll happen.

Bummer, dude.
But the time's just not right for that action.

Klopstein and Cabot,
We just won't have it,
We know exactly who you are.

Tariq and Shep Williams,
The pages they will fill 'em
Well, phony names will only go so far.

You're getting sued.

It was built of ivory bricks and glass and towered in the sky
I lived above my brother and beside my father too
But they hardly ever saw me as I hung out on the roof
And I looked out on the city and the taxi cabs below
I would cherish that I had this little place to call my own
Well I thought I knew the future of the mountains in my range
If the future taught me anything the past can never change

Well I sit atop this city blowing smoke rings in the sky
With the twin peaks looming way above the place where I get high
And 10 million heads below me on an island I call mine
But we all find away to share it while we avoid each others eyes
But the truth is that these people are as much my family
As we share a love for mountains that are circled by the sea
While I look upon the city that I’ve grown to call my own
No matter where this journey takes me this place will always be my home

Whooooo-oooah
Sitting on a mountain top, fifteen miles (although now I think they sing floors) above the city
Whooooo-oooah

Take heed what the wise all had in store
Count this time

after intro, the chord they hit is a F# major played 
on the 2nd fret.
They keep hitting this until you get to the next part, which is the part
during the verse too.

the way barber plays this kinda has this shuffle feel to it. the chords dont really sustain at all. for best 
results don't press down all the way on the strings 
to keep it from sounding too loud, avoiding the heavy 
pick attack sound.

Don't let them tell you what you like
Don't let them tell you where you want to go
Don't let them sell you all the hype
Don't let it get you down, get you down
Don't let it scare you into buyin
Don't let them get inside your credit card
Don't let them get inside your mind

It's no secret that we do our own thing
We like to party, we like to party hard
It's no secret that we let it all out
We like to dance, sorry if you don't

Don't let them tell you what to wear to school
Don't let them make you multiply
Don't let them try to make you think their thoughts
Don't let them say it's classified
Don't ever let them sell you rhetoric
Don't ever let them tell you lies
Don't let them tell you that you're paranoid
Don't let them make you wear a tie",,"Debuted on 10/25/2010","0"

You n I should get down and multiply
You're kind of amazing like a time machine
So I free your solutions and dream when you scream

So there, I want you to feel amazing
So there, you n me so crazy

Newspapers filled with alibis
And you like your rebels with appetites
I'm always confused by what you do
But you kill it in heels and attitude",,,"0"

Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn
Burnin'

To mass fires, yes
One hundred stories high
People gettin' loose y'all
Gettin' down on the roof, do you hear?

The folks was flaming
Out of control
It was so entertainin'
When the boogie started to explode
I heard somebody say

Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn that mama down
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn that mama down
Burnin'

Satisfaction
Came in the chain reaction

I couldn't get enough
Till I had to self-destroy

The heat was on

Rising to the top
Everybody's goin' strong
And that is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say

Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn that mama down, yo
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn that mama down

Up above my head, I hear music in the air
I hear music
That makes me know
There's somebody somewhere

Satisfaction
Came in a chain reaction, do you hear?
I couldn't get enough
So I had to self destruct

The heat was on

That's a sex machine to all the chicks?
Shaft!
Ya damn right

Who is the man that would risk his neck for his brother man?
Shaft!
Can you dig it?

Who's the cat that won't cop out when there's danger all about?
[ From: http://www.elyrics.net ]
Shaft!
Right On

They say this cat Shaft is a bad mother
Shut your mouth!
I'm talkin' 'bout Shaft.
Then we can dig it

He's a complicated man
But no one understands him but his woman
John Shaft!

"421","sawyer","Tom Sawyer","Rush","A modern day warrior
Mean, mean stride
Today's Tom Sawyer
Mean, mean pride

Though his mind is not for rent
Don't put him down as arrogant
His reserve, a quiet defense
Riding out the day's events
The river

What you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the mist, catch the myth
Catch the mystery, catch the drift

The world is, the world is
Love and life are deep
Maybe as his skies are wide

Today's Tom Sawyer
He gets high on you
And the space he invades
He gets by on you

No his mind is not for rent
To any god or government
Always hopeful, yet discontent
He knows changes aren't permanent
But change is

What you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the witness, catch the wit
Catch the spirit, catch the spit

The world is, the world is
Love and life are deep
Maybe as his eyes are wide

Exit the warrior
Today's Tom Sawyer
He gets high on you
And the energy you trade
He gets right on to the friction of the day",,"first played on 09/28/13","0"
